# GradeGuardian

## Summary
GradeGuardian is a chatbot primarily built using Amazon Bedrock and LlamaIndex. It leverages Amazon S3 knowledge bases to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through a hybrid search method combining both vector and keyword searches. The integration with LaunchDarkly's feature flags and Bedrock allows for quick and seamless switching between different RAG search methods and Claude 3 models. Additionally, Bedrock's guardrail filters have been implemented to prevent profane or harmful responses.
